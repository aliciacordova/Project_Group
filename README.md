# CRYPTO_PUNKS_Project

## Presentation
Content
Team members have drafted their project, including the following:
✓ Selected topic: Explore the surging world of  NFT focus on a collection of 10.000 Crypto Punks as PNG images, to establish which features and attributes using Machine Learning determine which type of Crypto Punk is such as “Male', 'Female', 'Zombie'. 'Ape' or 'Alien'.

✓ Reason why they selected their topic: 
With this project we want to achive and learn new skills with Machine Learning that could be applied in most of the trendind topics nowadays and classifies images.   

✓ Description of their source of data: CryptoPunks were created by Larva Labs in 2017, are the first NFT series to catch popular interest, and one of the most actively traded. The dataset consists of all CryptoPunk transactions, since 2017, and PNG images of the 10,000 Punks


✓ Questions they hope to answer with the data

Note: The content does not yet need to be in the form of a presentation; text in
the README.md works as well. 

## GitHub

Main Branch 
✓ Includes a README.md

README.md README.md must include: 

✓ Description of the communication protocols

Individual Branches
✓ At least one branch for each team member 
✓ Each team member has at least four commits from the duration of the first segment

Note: The descriptions and explanations required in all other project deliverables should also be in your README.md as part of your outline, unless otherwise noted.

## Machine Learning Model

Team members present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:
✓ Takes in data in from the provisional database 
✓ Outputs label(s) for input data

## Database

Team members present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following:
✓ Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema 
✓ Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database
